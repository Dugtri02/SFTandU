<p>Welcome to <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1297132007964540958">Simple Forum Tags and Utilities</a>, a Discord bot designed to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for managing forum tags and utilities.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our bot.</p>

<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>

<p>We collect and store the following types of data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guild IDs</li>
  <li>Guild Names</li>
  <li>Channel IDs</li>
  <li>Channel Names</li>
  <li>User IDs</li>
  <li>User Names</li>
  <li>Role IDs</li>
  <li>Role Names</li>
  <li>Tag IDs</li>
  <li>Tag Names</li>
  <li>User Inputed Data (i.e. Tag/Role Names, Reasons for Closing/Managing)</li>
</ul>

<p>We collect and store this data to provide and improve our services. We use this data to manage and customize the bot's behavior for each guild, and to provide features such as tag management.</p>

<p><strong>Additional data retention for banned guilds:</strong> In cases where a guild is banned from using our bot due to violations of our terms of service or Discord's terms of service, we permanently store the Guild ID of banned servers. This information is retained until either (1) we decide to lift the ban and remove the Guild ID from our banned list, or (2) the bot service is permanently shut down. This retention is necessary to enforce bans and protect our service from misuse.</p>

<h3>Data Retention and Your Rights</h3>

<p>We hold the data we collect indefinitely, unless it is removed according to the methods described below. As a data subject, you have the right to request that we delete or remove personal data we hold about you.</p>

<p><strong>For server owners:</strong> You can remove all data associated with your server in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using the <code>/admin data clear</code> command within your Discord server</li>
  <li>Removing (kicking) the bot from your server</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>For individual users:</strong> If you leave a Discord server where our bot is installed, your personal information (such as your User ID and Username) will automatically be removed from that server's data pool. This only affects data for the specific server you left.</p>

<p>Please note that these are the only methods available for data removal, and we do not process manual requests through our support server or other channels. All automated requests are processed immediately.</p>

<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>We use some of the information we collect for statistical purposes, such as to understand how our bot is being used and to identify areas for improvement. We also use this information to help the bot function properly and to provide features such as tag management.</p>

<p>We do not share your personal data with any third parties, and we only use it for the purposes described above. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data with anyone.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We take reasonable measures to ensure that the data we collect and store is secure and protected from unauthorized access. We use industry-standard security practices to protect our databases and servers, and we regularly review and update our security measures to ensure they remain effective.</p>
<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>

<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, without notice to you. Your continued use of the bot after any changes to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the new Policy.</p>
