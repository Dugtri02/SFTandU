## Close Tag│`/admin defclosetag`
Close Tags are automatically applied when using the /close command, which is available to the Original Poster (OP), users with Tag Manager roles, and Forum Staff.

- When a post is closed (using the /close command), the configured close tag is applied.
- Each forum channel can have one close tag.
- This tag must be one of the tags available in that Discord forum channel.
- It will toggle off any present Toggle Tags.

Close tags can be combined with special tag properties like "Delete on Close" for thread management.
