## **Toggle Tags│`/togtags` **
-# Toggle Tags are special tags that can be toggled on or off in a forum post when a user sends a message in the Post.

How Toggle Tags Work
- Each forum channel can have up to 2 toggle tags.
- Toggle tags are useful for marking posts as "Pending", "In Progress", "Solved", etc.
- When a Close Tag is applied to a post (/close), any active Toggle Tags on that post are automatically removed.

Example usage:
- Set a toggle tag -> "In-Progress"
- User B (non-OP) sends a message which will have the bot "toggle" the tag onto the post. subsequent messages don't toggle it off.
- User A (OP) uses /close and the "In-Progress" is removed and replaced by the configured "Close" tag
