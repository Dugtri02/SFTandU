## **Auto Tags│`/autotag` **
-# Auto Tags are automatically applied to new posts in a forum channel. Each forum channel can have one auto tag.

- To set an auto tag you'll first need **pre-made tags** available in the forum channel.
- When a post is made the bot will attempt to add the tag you specified to that forum post, but it may fail if the bot does not have `Manage Posts` enabled.
